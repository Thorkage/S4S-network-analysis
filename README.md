# Community network analysis of the Science for Sustainability theme of Utrecht University🧑‍🧑‍🧒

This project was initiated in early 2024 as a student assistant project. It shall serve as a demo to test a network driven approach to **get a better understanding of what a community of researcheres is made up of**. The analysis has been performed on a set of researchers who are to some extent involved in the Science for Sustainability community of Utrecht University (find more info here: https://www.uu.nl/en/research/sustainability/science-for-sustainability). More extensive documentation about the project can be found in the *docs* folder, along with 2 presentations held at an advisory board and board meeting, respectively. Additionally, a short video presenting the project can be found at: https://vimeo.com/973065588.

The code generated for this project can be roughly seperated into three steps: (1) Data collection, (2) Data processing and (3) Visualization
